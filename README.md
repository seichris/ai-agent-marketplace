# Fast-Native Agent Data Marketplace v1

Greenfield TypeScript workspace for a Fast-native paid data marketplace with x402 route charges, variable top-ups, prepaid credit, provider payouts, and wallet-bound auth.

## Workspace

- `apps/api`: Express gateway with x402 compatibility, wallet auth, provider passthrough routes, prepaid-credit runtime endpoints, and the marketplace-owned Tavily example
- `apps/facilitator`: x402 facilitator service for payment verification
- `apps/web`: Next.js marketplace frontend for service discovery, `SKILL.md`, and suggestion intake
- `apps/worker`: async job poller, refund worker, stale-payment reconciler, and provider payout settlement worker
- `packages/shared`: shared route registry, billing contracts, auth, payment compatibility, docs, payout logic, and credit stores
- `packages/cli`: buyer CLI for wallet, x402 invocation, prepaid-credit invocation, API sessions, and job retrieval

## Implementation Example

This repo includes a concrete marketplace-owned third-party API integration: `Tavily Search`.

- buyer-facing route: `POST /api/tavily/search`
- upstream route: `POST https://api.tavily.com/search`
- auth: server-side `TAVILY_API_KEY`
- catalog behavior: the Tavily service is only published when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is configured

This is the reference example for "marketplace-operated wrapper" routes in v1. The marketplace owns the public catalog entry, pricing, and payment flow, while the API executes the upstream request with server-held credentials.

## Billing Model

Marketplace routes use one of three billing modes:

- `fixed_x402`: standard paid route; buyer sends the request, gets `402 Payment Required`, pays with x402, then retries the same request
- `topup_x402_variable`: buyer supplies an amount in the request body, pays that exact amount with x402, and receives marketplace-managed service credit
- `prepaid_credit`: buyer first funds service credit, then invokes the route with wallet-session bearer auth instead of paying x402 on every call

## Settlement Tiers

Services publish under one of two settlement tiers:

- `community_direct`: buyer pays the provider wallet directly through x402, provider-owned refunds and reimbursements, no marketplace treasury custody
- `verified_escrow`: buyer pays marketplace treasury, marketplace can refund failures, reconcile stale payments, support prepaid credit, and settle provider payouts later

New provider-created drafts default to `community_direct`. Marketplace-operated seeded services remain `verified_escrow`, and only `verified_escrow` services can publish `topup_x402_variable` or `prepaid_credit` routes.

For `verified_escrow`, successful route charges and top-ups create provider payout records, and the worker batches and sends those payouts on Fast. `community_direct` does not create treasury payout records because the buyer already paid the provider wallet directly.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set environment variables:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/fast_marketplace
export MARKETPLACE_TREASURY_ADDRESS=fast1...
export MARKETPLACE_FACILITATOR_URL=http://localhost:4020
export MARKETPLACE_SESSION_SECRET=change-me
export MARKETPLACE_SECRETS_KEY=change-me-again
export MARKETPLACE_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me-too
export MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=mainnet
export MARKETPLACE_WEB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
export TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
```

Use long random values for `MARKETPLACE_SESSION_SECRET` and `MARKETPLACE_SECRETS_KEY`.

Optional refund worker variables:

```bash
export MARKETPLACE_TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY=<fast-ed25519-private-key-hex>
export FAST_RPC_URL=https://api.fast.xyz/proxy
```

`MARKETPLACE_SECRETS_KEY` is required. It is used for provider runtime keys, encrypted upstream secrets, and signed marketplace identity headers for Community/direct and prepaid-credit providers.

Optional facilitator variables:

```bash
export FACILITATOR_PORT=4020
export FACILITATOR_FAST_RPC_URL=https://api.fast.xyz/proxy
export FACILITATOR_EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<evm-private-key-if-you-later-enable-evm-settlement>
```

Optional frontend variables:

```bash
export MARKETPLACE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

`MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK` supports `mainnet` or `testnet`. The deployment token is `fastUSDC` on mainnet and `testUSDC` on testnet.

3. Run the facilitator:

```bash
npm run dev:facilitator
```

4. Run the API:

```bash
npm run dev:api
```

5. Run the worker:

```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

6. Run the web app:

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

7. Use the CLI:

```bash
npm run cli -- wallet init
npm run cli -- wallet address
npm run cli -- invoke mock quick-insight --body '{"query":"alpha"}'
npm run cli -- invoke tavily search --body '{"query":"latest Fast blockchain updates","topic":"general","max_results":5}'
```

For prepaid-credit routes, the CLI can mint an API-scoped wallet session automatically when the route responds with auth requirements instead of `402`. You can also create that session explicitly:

```bash
npm run cli -- auth api-session <provider> <operation>
```

For provider-authored top-up routes, call the route with an amount in the request body. For prepaid-credit routes, fund credit first, then call the prepaid route with the same `invoke` command; the CLI will switch to wallet-session auth when needed.

8. Build runtime artifacts:

```bash
npm run build
```

9. Start production-style processes:

```bash
npm run start:api
npm run start:facilitator
npm run start:worker
npm run start:web
```

## Docker Deployment

Use the repo-root Docker context with one Dockerfile per service:

- API: `docker/api.Dockerfile`
- Facilitator: `docker/facilitator.Dockerfile`
- Web: `docker/web.Dockerfile`
- Worker: `docker/worker.Dockerfile`

Required API environment:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
MARKETPLACE_TREASURY_ADDRESS=fast1...
MARKETPLACE_FACILITATOR_URL=https://fastfacilitator.example.com
MARKETPLACE_SESSION_SECRET=change-me
MARKETPLACE_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me-too
MARKETPLACE_SECRETS_KEY=change-me-again
MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=mainnet
MARKETPLACE_BASE_URL=https://fastapi.example.com
MARKETPLACE_WEB_BASE_URL=https://fast.example.com
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
PORT=3000
```

Required worker environment:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
MARKETPLACE_TREASURY_PRIVATE_KEY=<fast-ed25519-private-key-hex>
MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=mainnet
FAST_RPC_URL=https://api.fast.xyz/proxy
WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=5000
```

The worker now handles:

- async job polling and completion
- treasury refunds for failed jobs and unrecoverable stale paid requests
- provider payout settlement for route charges and top-up purchases

Facilitator environment:

```bash
FACILITATOR_PORT=4020
FACILITATOR_FAST_RPC_URL=https://api.fast.xyz/proxy
```

Required web environment:

```bash
MARKETPLACE_API_BASE_URL=https://fastapi.example.com
MARKETPLACE_WEB_BASE_URL=https://fast.example.com
MARKETPLACE_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me-too
MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=mainnet
PORT=3000
```

If you want both networks, deploy two stacks from the same repo:

- mainnet: `MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=mainnet`
- testnet: `MARKETPLACE_FAST_NETWORK=testnet`

Keep the web, API, and worker on the same network value inside each stack. The facilitator can stay shared if it supports both Fast networks.

## Website Wallet Login

The web app supports wallet login with the Fast browser extension through `@fastxyz/fast-connector`.

- login happens in the site header via a signed wallet challenge
- this creates a short-lived website session token
- service pages support in-browser x402 execution for payable endpoints through the extension
- prepaid-credit routes use wallet-session auth instead of x402 at invoke time
- async browser calls can refresh job results by signing a job-specific challenge with the same wallet

## Provider Credit Runtime

Provider runtime keys are used in two cases:

- `community_direct` HTTP routes: the marketplace forwards signed buyer identity headers so the provider can trust the requester wallet and `X-MARKETPLACE-REQUEST-ID`
- `verified_escrow` prepaid-credit routes: the provider uses the runtime credit APIs to reserve, capture, and release marketplace-held credit

Provider runtime key operations:

- rotate a runtime key from the provider service dashboard or `POST /provider/services/:id/runtime-key`
- marketplace forwards signed buyer identity headers to the provider upstream when the settlement flow requires them
- provider backends reserve, capture, and release buyer credit through:
  - `POST /provider/runtime/credits/reserve`
  - `POST /provider/runtime/credits/:reservationId/capture`
  - `POST /provider/runtime/credits/:reservationId/release`
- top-up purchases recognize provider revenue at purchase time; later credit consumption does not create a second provider payout
